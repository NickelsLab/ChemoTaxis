Training Images in Matlab.

//Take pictures with the takePicure.m matlab file.
//Note that pictures update after you press enter.
//So the the current picture will be visually updated when you
have taken the next picture. 

1.) Calibrate camera. 
	a. make sure that you have 10-15 images of the checkerboard.
	b. Go into matlab's camera calibrator app.
	c. Load images in the app, and press calibrate.
	d. export camera parameters (should be a button next to calibrate)
	e. save the cameraparams as a .mat file in the directory that you are working under.

2.) Train the image detector and output a .xml file
	a. Make two folders (Positive images, Negative images) (100 positive images) (25 negative ImageCount)
	b. Fill the folders with images of the object and images without the object.
	c. Open the Training Image Labeler from matlab
	d. Go through and label all Regions of Interest with the bounding box tool.
	e. save as a labelingSession.mat file
	f. Run TrainZumo.m
	g. One of the .xml files is the best fit for the particular training session. 
3. run findLoc.m
4. Enter URI code of ROSCORE master ex: 'http://ros2:11311/'


Comments:

Repeatedly I got black screens. For some reason if you restart the computer kinect_mex resumes working.

Also findLoc assumes only one identifying bounding box is found.
